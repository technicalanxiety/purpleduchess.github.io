This piece emerged from a series of evening walks where I found myself captivated by the way purple hues dominated the sky during twilight. The interplay between warm and cool tones creates a sense of movement and depth that invites the viewer to lose themselves in the layers.

I worked with multiple glazing techniques to build up the translucent quality of the atmosphere, allowing each layer to dry completely before adding the next. This process took nearly three weeks, but the luminous effect was worth the patience.

The composition deliberately avoids a clear horizon line, encouraging viewers to find their own sense of orientation within the work. Some see landscapes, others see abstract emotion—both interpretations are equally valid and intentional.
